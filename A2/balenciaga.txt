          Yves Saint Laurent SAS, also known as Saint Laurent and YSL, is a French luxury fashion house 
          founded in 1962 by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé. During the 1960s and 1970s, 
          YSL popularized the beatnik look, safari jackets, tight pants, and thigh-high boots. In 1966, 
          YSL debuted Le Smoking, a tuxedo suit for women. In an attempt to democratize fashion, YSL began 
          producing ready-to-wear in 1966, with its launch of Rive Gauche, and is considered to be the 
          first to popularize the concept.

          In the December of 1953 in Paris, Saint Laurent met Michel de Brunhoff, who was then editor-in-chief 
          of the French Vogue magazine and a connection to his father. Michel, known by some as a considerate 
          person who encouraged new talent, was impressed by the sketches that Saint Laurent brought with him 
          and suggested he should intend to become a fashion designer. Saint Laurent eventually considered a 
          course of study at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, the council which regulates the haute 
          couture industry and provides training to its employees.

          Saint Laurent followed his advice and, left Oran for Paris after graduation, began his studies there and 
          eventually graduated as a star pupil. Later, that same year, he entered the International Wool 
          Secretariat competition again and won, beating out his friend Fernando Sánchez and young German 
          student Karl Lagerfeld. After his win, Yves showed some sketches to Michel, who recognized close 
          similarities to sketches he had been shown that morning by Christian Dior. Knowing that Dior had created 
          the sketches that morning and that the young man could not have seen them, de Brunhoff sent him to Dior,
          who hired him on the spot.

          Although Dior recognised his talent immediately, Saint Laurent spent his first year at the House of Dior 
          on mundane tasks, such as decorating the studio and designing accessories. Eventually he was allowed to 
          submit sketches for the couture collection. With every passing season, more of his sketches were accepted 
          by Dior. In August 1957, Dior met with Saint Laurent's mother to tell her that he had chosen Saint Laurent 
          to succeed him as a designer.

          In 1960, Saint Laurent found himself conscripted to serve in the French Army during the Algerian War of 
          Independence. Neri Karra writes that there was speculation at the time that Marcel Boussac, the owner of 
          the House of Dior and a powerful press baron, had put pressure on the government not to conscript Saint 
          Laurent in 1958 and 1959, but after the disastrous Fall 1958 season, reversed course and asked that the 
          designer be conscripted so that he could be replaced.

          Saint Laurent was in the military for 20 days before 
          the stress of hazing by fellow soldiers led to him being admitted to a military hospital, where he received 
          news that he had been fired from Dior, to be replaced by Marc Bohan. This exacerbated his condition, and he 
          was transferred to Val-de-Grâce military hospital, where he was given large doses of sedatives and psychoactive 
          drugs and subjected to electroshock therapy. Saint Laurent himself traced the origin of both his mental 
          problems and his drug addictions to this time in hospital.

          Saint Laurent died on 1 June 2008 of brain cancer at his residence in Paris. According to The New York Times, 
          a few days prior, he and Bergé had been joined in a same-sex civil union known as a Pacte civil de solidarité (PACS) 
          in France. When Saint Laurent was diagnosed as terminal, with only one or two weeks left to live, Bergé and the 
          doctor mutually decided that it would be better for him not to know of his impending death. Bergé said, "I have 
          the belief that Yves would not have been strong enough to accept that."
