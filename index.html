      <h1> What is fashion and what is lifestyle? </h1>
      <div class= "pagegrid">
        <div class="pagewords">
          Some believe the two have a huge difference, while 
          others think they are closely related. Regardless of your thinking, fashion and lifestyle are 
          both undeniably important components of our daily lives. It’s true that some people view 
          fashion as materialistic and shallow, but to reduce it to that oversimplifies it and leaves 
          out the cultural importance and artistry of the field.
        </div>

      <div class= "pagegrid"> <div class="pageimg"><img src="imgs/fashionlifestyle2.jpg" alt="Image"></div>
        <div class="pagewords">
        People frequently dress in accordance with what is trendy or in vogue. This might be the result 
        of following fashion trends, a desire to be stylish, or a number of other factors. However, 
        lifestyle decisions vary. Chic people make decisions focusing on how they will impact their way 
        of life as a whole. For instance, someone might decide to purchase eco-friendly apparel because 
        it aligns with their environmental principles.
        </div>
      </div>
      <h1> Summary </h1>
      <div class= "pagegrid">
        <div class="pagewords">
          Fashion can represent your mood, personal style, or current trends. It is an expression of who 
          you are. On the other hand, your way of life refers to how you conduct your daily affairs. It 
          includes your food, exercise regimen, social life, and work/life balance, among other things. 
          Your lifestyle and fashion may overlap, but they are not the same thing. While lifestyle refers 
          to a way of life, fashion is all about the things you wear and the trends you follow. It involves
          your way of life, your diet, your leisure activities, and the people you associate with. 
          To have a chic lifestyle, you need to be well-rounded and stylish in all aspects of your life.

          Balenciaga is a luxury fashion house founded in 1919 by the Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga in 
          San Sebastian, Spain, and currently based in Paris. Balenciaga produces ready-to-wear footwear, handbags, 
          and accessories, and licenses its name and branding to COTY for fragrances. It is currently owned by the 
          French corporation Kering.

          Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1919, and expanded to include 
          branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and aristocracy wore his designs. When the 
          Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, he moved to Paris. Customers risked their safety traveling 
          to Europe during World War II to see Balenciaga's clothing. During this period, he was noted for his "square 
          coat", with sleeves cut in a single piece with the yoke, and for his designs with black lace over bright pink 
          fabric.

        <div class="balenciwords">
          Historians believe that Balenciaga's continued activity during the Nazi occupation of Paris was made 
          possible by his connections with Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco who was Adolf Hitler's close ally. 
          The relationship with Franco was so close that Balenciaga designed clothing for the Franco family. The company 
          was one of only 60 allowed to operate during the occupation, and the ongoing supply of raw materials from Spain, 
          which was in short supply in Paris due to the war, gave Balenciaga a competitive advantage. However, he testified
          that he refused Hitler's request to transfer his company's activities to Berlin.

          Chrome Hearts is a luxury brand from Hollywood, founded in 1988 by Richard Stark, Leonard Kamhout and John Bowman.
          Richard and John started the business in a Los Angeles where John was a manufacturer of leather goods and Stark 
          merchandised top grade raw leathers. The third partner was master sterling silver jeweller Leonard Kamhout. It is 
          currently co-owned by Richard Stark and his wife Laurie Lynn Stark. Its logo contains a cross with the brand name 
          around it on a circular ribbon. The brand produces silver, gold, and diamond accessories, alongside eyewear, leather, 
          clothing and furniture.

          They initially established the label in order to produce leather jackets that weren't available on the market. 
          In 1992, the brand was awarded Accessory Designer Award of the Year by the CFDA. In 1994, Stark, Bowman, and Kamhout 
          had a falling-out, and Bowman and Kamhout withdrew from the brand. Since 1994, Chrome Hearts has been co-owned by Richard 
          his wife. In the early 2000s, Chrome Hearts began publishing its own fashion magazine, which featured interviews and 
          celebrity photoshoots, many of which were shot by Laurie. It was published until 2017.

          The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris. Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite 
          trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight.  
          Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. 
          It was Vuitton's gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other 
          luggage makers later imitated Vuitton's style and design.

          In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, and the company's management passed to his son. After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign 
          to build the company into a worldwide corporation, exhibiting the company's products at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. In 1896, the company 
          launched the signature Monogram Canvas and made the worldwide patents on it. Its graphic symbols, including quatrefoils and flowers (as well 
          as the LV monogram), were based on the trend of using Japaneseingle piece with the yoke, and for his designs with black lace over bright pink 
          fabric.

          During World War II, Louis Vuitton collaborated with the Nazis during the German occupation of France. The French book Louis Vuitton, A French 
          Saga, authored by French journalist Stephanie Bonvicini and published by Paris-based Editions Fayard, tells how members of the Vuitton family 
          actively aided the Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain and increased their wealth from their business affairs with the Germans. The 
          family set up a factory dedicated to producing artefacts glorifying Pétain, including more than 2,500 busts.

          The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the current 
          Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the opening year.Founder Christian Dior was financially backed by 
          wealthy businessman Marcel Boussac. Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, 
          but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. The 
          new couture house became a part of "a vertically integrated textile business" already operated by Boussac.

          On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show 
          of "90 models of his first collection on six mannequins" was presented in the salons of the company's 
          eadquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Originally, the two lines were named "Corolle" and "Huit". However, the 
          new collection went down in fashion history as the "New Look". The New Look became extremely popular, its 
          full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number 
          of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, 
          which had fallen from its position as the capital of the fashion world after World War II, regained its 
          preeminence.

          Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York 
          City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total 
          export revenue. Christian Dior then made massive progressions through fashion for the next few years, however, 
          the designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack on 24 October 1957. The captivating impact of Dior's 
          creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history's greatest fashion figures. Kevin Almond for 
          Contemporary Fashion wrote that "by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury."

          To bring the label back on its feet, general manager Jacques Rouët promoted the 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent 
          to Artistic Director the same year. Saint Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being personally 
          picked out by the Dior for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant. Saint Laurent initially 
          proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention 
          of Dior from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958. The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly 
          proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and 
          easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero.

          One of the first boutiques to carry his clothes was Charles Gallay, who was known for carrying avant-garde

          but due to the terrorist attacks of September 11, it had to be delayed. This collection exhibited his draped 
          and tailored designs that he gained popularity for in the Hollywood Boulevard in a muted color palette. It was 
          a minimalistic presentation, contrasting his later shows that would feature extravagant set-pieces and performances.

          He moved to Paris in 2003 with his partner Michèle Lamy, a decision that was partially motivated by being
          mugged in Los Angeles. He set up his home and atelier inside a historic five-story building that previously 
          served as offices for former French President François Mitterrand. His runway collections have been mounted

          Yves Saint Laurent SAS, also known as Saint Laurent and YSL, is a French luxury fashion house 
          founded in 1962 by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé. During the 1960s and 1970s, 
          YSL popularized the beatnik look, safari jackets, tight pants, and thigh-high boots. In 1966, 
          YSL debuted Le Smoking, a tuxedo suit for women. In an attempt to democratize fashion, YSL began 
          producing ready-to-wear in 1966, with its launch of Rive Gauche, and is considered to be the 
          first to popularize the concept.

          In the December of 1953 in Paris, Saint Laurent met Michel de Brunhoff, who was then editor-in-chief 
          of the French Vogue magazine and a connection to his father. Michel, known by some as a considerate 
          person who encouraged new talent, was impressed by the sketches that Saint Laurent brought with him 
          and suggested he should intend to become a fashion designer. Saint Laurent eventually considered a 
          course of study at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, the council which regulates the haute 
          couture industry and provides training to its employees.

          Saint Laurent followed his advice and, left Oran for Paris after graduation, began his studies there and 
          eventually graduated as a star pupil. Later, that same year, he entered the International Wool 
          Secretariat competition again and won, beating out his friend Fernando Sánchez and young German 
          student Karl Lagerfeld. After his win, Yves showed some sketches to Michel, who recognized close 
          similarities to sketches he had been shown that morning by Christian Dior. Knowing that Dior had created 
          the sketches that morning and that the young man could not have seen them, de Brunhoff sent him to Dior,
          who hired him on the spot.

          Although Dior recognised his talent immediately, Saint Laurent spent his first year at the House of Dior 
          on mundane tasks, such as decorating the studio and designing accessories. Eventually he was allowed to 
          submit sketches for the couture collection. With every passing season, more of his sketches were accepted 
          by Dior. In August 1957, Dior met with Saint Laurent's mother to tell her that he had chosen Saint Laurent 
          to succeed him as a designer.

          In 1960, Saint Laurent found himself conscripted to serve in the French Army during the Algerian War of 
          Independence. Neri Karra writes that there was speculation at the time that Marcel Boussac, the owner of 
          the House of Dior and a powerful press baron, had put pressure on the government not to conscript Saint 
          Laurent in 1958 and 1959, but after the disastrous Fall 1958 season, reversed course and asked that the 
          designer be conscripted so that he could be replaced.

          Saint Laurent was in the military for 20 days before 
          the stress of hazing by fellow soldiers led to him being admitted to a military hospital, where he received 
          news that he had been fired from Dior, to be replaced by Marc Bohan. This exacerbated his condition, and he 
          was transferred to Val-de-Grâce military hospital, where he was given large doses of sedatives and psychoactive 
          drugs and subjected to electroshock therapy. Saint Laurent himself traced the origin of both his mental 
          problems and his drug addictions to this time in hospital.

          Saint Laurent died on 1 June 2008 of brain cancer at his residence in Paris. According to The New York Times, 
          a few days prior, he and Bergé had been joined in a same-sex civil union known as a Pacte civil de solidarité (PACS) 
          in France. When Saint Laurent was diagnosed as terminal, with only one or two weeks left to live, Bergé and the 
          doctor mutually decided that it would be better for him not to know of his impending death. Bergé said, "I have 
          the belief that Yves would not have been strong enough to accept that."
